Recirculating neural network for image compression and decompression
======================================================================

This project is an individual student work on the development of a neural network for image compression and decompression. 
This neural network was developed in Python without the use of third-party libraries for network training. 
Mathematical operations on matrices and learning functions are written by hand.
